Wednesday, 11/28/2012 4:30pm- Teresa did the 2012 data! :D the .R file is in the 
DropBox folder; just source it and call parse2012results().  Do we have a convention 
for the county names?  all lowercase?  remove dashes/periods?  Please advise :] also 
look at my awesome data fraaaaame AVERAGERS FTW. sorry guys I'm really sleep-deprived 
and excited to have this done.

11/29 (1:25 AM) [Matt] I don't think we need to make careful logs of when we worked,
just when we worked together. Anyways, I created a file "FinalProject.R" where we can 
start combining our code tomorrow (well technically today) after class.
I added the code to extract the 2004 vote data (2004ElecFuncs.txt). I'll see if I can
get the GML extraction done by the end of class tomorrow...done or not we should be
able to begin merging tomorrow though.

11/29 2pm - Arif, Matt, Teresa met in Bechtel during class time to work on merging 
our data and identifying "problem counties", which are listed below:

[[de baca]]
[[de soto]]

11/30 5pm - Matt here, just finished processing geo data...I also created a short function 
called "CountyFix" which we can use to quickly make single county corrections prior to merging

12/1 3:41pm - Group met up to attempt to merge all data. Data from Census was refined in order to make merging easier.

12/3 10:42pm: Arif atm, K nearest Neighbor was attempted and almost completed, issues involve a difference between numbers and winning party..

12/7 (Teresa) - hey guys, I saved the final data frame to FinalDF.rda so we don't have to keep sourcing the FinalProject.R file which takes a super-long time..

12/9 - Group finished the plots, credit to Teresa for her amazing maps plots
