Okay!!! The data frame is fully merged
I backed up FinalProject.R onto my own computer, and it should be in the dropbox
[[DO NOT EDIT FINAL PROJECT.R DIRECTLY]] - upload .R or .txt files of the changes
you want to make...I'll do all the editing of FinalProject.R to avoid issues of
simultaneous editing. You can open the file up but just copy what you need and then
close it asap (since apparently someone has an autosaving computer)

==We need to meet tomorrow to decide what variables we are going to
keep vs what we are going to toss==
(at least one person from each group)


Also: we don't have the data for the 2004 election data in Virginia for some reason
(it isn't even in raw, un-manipulated data). All that work trying to solve what to do
with Virginia and we may end up cutting it anyways...

Alaska and Puerto we are definitely going to cut, and probably Hawaii as well. I hope
we don't end up cutting Virginia, as that would be strange


- Matt ....if you have any comments or messages post it here and hopefully the title
will grab someone's attention


[Teresa, 12/3]  I don't think we need to cut Virginia; we just won't have data so some stuff will turn into NAs.. like I think we're supposed to compare 2004 to 2012 when we do the map with the arrows.  Virginia just won't have arrows.  nbd.

Hi everyone, part 1 should now be completely complete....hopefully
Go ahead and use the data frame, but DO NOT SAVE ANYTHING TO FINAL PROJECT.R
put your results in a text file and I will add it to Final Project.R to eliminate the risk
of multiple-people-editing



EDIT 5:28 12/3 - caught an error in the df with miamidade vs miami-dade (now all are miamidade)
also coerced longitude and latitude into numeric instead of factor
